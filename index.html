    Angela Huddleston, 54, went searching for a new job in July of 2020, but just two years out of prison, she wasn’t sure if her criminal record – two DUIs and one charge for possession of methamphetamine – would serve as an insurmountable barrier towards finding something better.<br><br>

    To her own surprise, she was soon offered a job offer at a nearby Chevy dealership in Vinita, Oklahoma that was desperate for employees and started working there as a receptionist. Her new position was an upgrade in every sense compared to the one she had at Dollar Tree, she said, between better pay and opportunities for career advancement.<br><br>

    “I applied one day and got hired the next,” said Huddleston, who is one of several employees working at the dealership with a criminal record. “I can honestly say they gave each of us a fair chance.”<br><br>

    Before the labor shortage took root, it wasn’t uncommon for applications from people with backgrounds like Huddleston’s to be placed at the bottom of a pile, but now employers are more likely to take a second look and hire candidates that might have once been seen as unfavorable.<br><br>

    The latest data collected by the Bureau of Labor and Statistics (BLS) shows job openings near record levels, with 11.3 million vacant positions across the country in the final days of February. Combined with an unemployment rate near pre-pandemic levels at 3.6%, the labor market is red-hot. U.S. businesses are in a bind, and the competition for workers is benefiting groups who often face discrimination, including those with disabilities or criminal records.<br><br>

    “In both cases, a tight labor market can help pull those workers in and get them the opportunities they’re interested in,” said AnnElizabeth Konkel, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab. “Employers can’t be as choosy as they might have been in the past.”<br><br>

    But the opportunity might not last forever, especially as the Fed continues raising interest rates and cools down the economy, which could greatly diminish the number of available jobs.<br><br>

    The federal government doesn’t collect employment statistics for people with criminal records, but data from Indeed suggests more businesses are taking on those impacted by the criminal justice system.<br><br>

    Employers advertise positions open to people with criminal histories by including terms in postings such as “felon friendly” and “criminal record will not disqualify,” among similar phrases. In March of this year, the number of job postings advertising what’s referred to as fair chance hiring on Indeed was up 33.7% compared to the same month in 2019 and 5% compared to March of 2020.<br><br>

    Despite the increase, those jobs still make up a small fraction of the overall postings, at just 2.5% of all jobs hosted on the website in March.<br><br>

    The share of searches by job seekers looking for positions on Indeed containing phrases like “no background check,” “felon friendly” and “second chance” is up 43.9% in the year through March and 134% compared to March of 2019.<br><br>

    Konkel said people with criminal backgrounds are hearing about the labor shortage and “thinking there may be an opportunity for me right now.”<br><br>

    A similar thought process is playing out among people with disabilities, including Eric Sogo, a 25-year-old from Staten Island, who faces mobility issues due to myotonic muscular dystrophy, a condition that causes weakness in his arms, hands and hips.<br><br>

    Sogo was let go from his job in July of 2021, but it only took him a couple of weeks to land a new position working as a lifestyle coach at a nonprofit called Person Centered Care Services. The only issue with his current job is that it requires in-person work, so he has to book an Access-A-Ride, a specialized transit service, a week in advance to make it to the office or rely on a family member to drive him instead.<br><br>

    “I wouldn't say that [transportation] is the most important thing, but it has been a huge factor” and often makes employment more complicated for the disabled, Sogo said, pointing out that Access-A-Ride frequently runs late. “It's important to note that people with disabilities, they might move at a different rate, but they can still do almost anything that other people could do.”<br><br>

    He’s hoping he can find a job that’s completely virtual before the coming winter because icy sidewalks can be perilous for someone with mobility needs like his, where Sogo uses a specialized walker to move around.<br><br>

    The Institute on Disability at the University of New Hampshire’s research director, Andrew Houtenville, said people with disabilities are currently seeing “unprecedented levels” of employment compared to their overall population, since the pandemic began.<br><br>

    77.3% of people without disabilities between the ages of 16 to 64 are either working or looking for a job, slightly below pre-pandemic levels, but for people with disabilities, the percentage of people participating in the workforce has increased from 33.8% in February of 2020 to 37.8% in March of this year.<br><br>

    Referred to as the labor force participation rate, the measurement for people without disabilities is at 99.3% of what it was when the pandemic began. Compared to that, the population for people with a disability is doing much better. The labor force participation rate for them has grown to 111.7% of what it was in February of 2020.<br><br>

    “The story here is that people with disabilities have recovered from the pandemic,” said Houtenville. “It could be that transportation is less of a barrier because there are more [job] opportunities, locally.”<br><br>

    <iframe title="Comparing changes in the labor force participation rate" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-WMEre" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/WMEre/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script>
    <br><br>

    He noted that working from home could be a benefit for some people with disabilities but not everyone, particularly workers that are looking for a higher degree of social integration and that it’s “dependent on the type of disability and those personal circumstances.”<br><br>

    The unemployment rate for working aged people with disabilities peaked at 19.7% in April of 2020 and has since moderated to 9.7%. However, last month showed a slight increase.<br><br>

    “That’s not necessarily a bad thing,” Houtenville said, suggesting the uptick in unemployment is because more “people with disabilities are starting to look for work … who had previously been disengaged from the labor force.”<br><br>

    There’s a chance that as the Fed tamps down on inflation by raising interest rates that businesses find it too costly to hire new employees and the benefits of a tight labor market will go away with the number of available jobs.<br><br>

    Sauve Gonzalez, who came home from prison in 2017 after serving 31 years for a murder he committed when he was 16, started working  as an administrator at the Community College of Philadelphia in February of this year and doesn’t see the change in perception towards people with criminal histories as anything less than a permanent shift.<br><br>

    “Once that door is open for you, it’s open for a lot of people,” he said. “If I do good, the chances are that they're going to hire two or three more people that've been formerly incarcerated.”<br><br>

    The program he oversees, called I Am More, helps people impacted by the criminal justice system transition into college by offering them specialized services that include mentorship, tutoring and a foot in the door with prospective employers. Recent participants of the program have secured jobs within Philadelphia’s City Hall and District Attorney’s Office.<br><br>

    “The narrative is changing,” he said. “If you have a certain skill that will be beneficial to an employer, they’re really going to consider you, and for some positions that lived experience is what they’re looking for.”<br><br>
